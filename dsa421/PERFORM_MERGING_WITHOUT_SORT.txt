PERFORM MERGING

Description

You are given two sorted arrays each of length N. Your task is to write a program that merges both the arrays such that the final array formed after merging is sorted.

Note: You must not use sort() function in your entire code


Input
Input Format :

First line contains N which is the number of integers present in both the arrays.

Second line contains N sorted integers which are elements of first array.

Third line contains N sorted integers which are elements of second array.



Constraints :

N < 1000


Output
Output the array formed after merging elements such that it is sorted


Sample Input 1 

4
1 5 7 9
2 4 6 8
Sample Output 1

1 2 4 5 6 7 8 9

<=========== SOLUTION =========>

const find=(s,arr1,arr2)=>{
     let result=[];
     for(var i=0;i<s;i++){
         if(arr1[i]<arr2[i]){
             result.push(arr1[i])
             result.push(arr2[i])
         }
         else{
             result.push(arr2[i])
             result.push(arr1[i])
         }
     }
     var k=0;
     while(k<s){
     for(var j=0;j<result.length;j++){
        if(result[j]>result[j+1]){
            [result[j],result[j+1]]= [result[j+1],result[j]]
        }
     }
     k++
     }
     result=result.join(" ")
     return result
 }


 console.log(find(s,arr1,arr2))
